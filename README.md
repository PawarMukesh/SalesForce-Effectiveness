# Sales-Client-Project-
* FicZon Inc is an IT solution provider with products ranging from on-premises products to SAAS based solutions.  * FicZon major leads generation channel is digital and through their website.  * FicZon business is majorly dependent on the sales force effectiveness.  * As the market is maturing and more new competitors entering the market, FicZon is experiencing the dip in sales.  * Effective sales is dependent on lead quality and as of now, this is based on manual categorization and highly depended on sales staff.  * Though there is a quality process, which continuously updates the lead categorization, it’s value is in for post analysis, rather than conversation. * FicZon wants to explore Machine Learning to pre-categorize the lead quality and as result, expecting significant increase in sales effectiveness
